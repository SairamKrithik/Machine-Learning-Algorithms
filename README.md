#### This repository contains basic implementations of Machine Learning techniques and models using Python packages.

### The packages used for the implementation are:
- **Pandas**
- **Numpy**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **Scikit-Learn Extra**
- **Seaborn**
- **Matplotlib**

### The algorithms are organized into two main categories:
- **Supervised Learning**
- **Unsupervised Learning**

# Machine Learning Algorithms

## Algorithms Overview

### Supervised Learning

1. **Linear Regression**:
   - Predicts a continuous dependent variable based on the linear relationship between independent variables.
   - **Example Use Case**: Predicting house prices, sales forecasting.

2. **Logistic Regression**:
   - Used for binary classification problems. It predicts the probability that a given input belongs to a certain class.
   - **Example Use Case**: Spam detection, medical diagnosis.

3. **Decision Trees**:
   - A tree-like model used to make decisions based on a series of feature values.
   - **Example Use Case**: Customer segmentation, loan approval.

4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**:
   - A powerful classification algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate data into different classes.
   - **Example Use Case**: Image classification, text categorization.

### Unsupervised Learning

1. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - Divides data into `k` clusters based on similarity, where each data point belongs to the nearest cluster mean.
   - **Example Use Case**: Market segmentation, document clustering.

2. **Hierarchical Clustering**:
   - Builds a tree-like structure (dendrogram) to represent nested clusters of data.
   - **Example Use Case**: Gene expression analysis, social network analysis.

3. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**:
   - Identifies clusters of varying shapes based on density, separating noise or outliers from the clusters.
   - **Example Use Case**: Anomaly detection, geospatial data analysis.

4. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:
   - A dimensionality reduction technique that transforms data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving most of the variance in the data.
   - **Example Use Case**: Reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional datasets, improving computational efficiency in ML models.
